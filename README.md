Space-Invaders

This is a game based on Space-Invaders made in scala! You play against an endless horde of alien enemies which you must fight against, the longer you survive the more difficult it gets. Use your arrows keys to move around and traverse the menu and the space bar to select/shoot. Be careful as the aliens fire back! You lose when you are either hit by an enemy's laser or are overrun. Included is also a leaderboard function where you can see your highscores and compare against your friends. Enjoy!
